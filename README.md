## Hi there 📍

I'm Bailey Walker. I graduated from Middlebury College in Febuary 2025 with a joint degree in Geography and Environmental Studies. 
I am passionate about using GIS and data science to tell complex stories about our world.

I work in QGIS, RStudio, Google Earth Engine, and Adobe Illustrator to compile and vizualize spatial data focused on relationships between humans and our environment.

I'm working to build out my portfolio from my work in college. Stay tuned for repositories of cartographic design, Google Earth Engine apps and more!
