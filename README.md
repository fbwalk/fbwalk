## Hi there 📍

I'm Bailey Walker, a student at Middlebury College studying Geography and Environmental Studies. 
I am passionate about using GIS and data science to tell complex stories about our world.

I work in QGIS, RStudio, Google Earth Engine, and Adobe Illustrator to compile and vizualize spatial data focused on relationships between humans and our environment.

I'm graduating this February 🎉 and working to build out my portfolio from my work in college. Stay tuned for repositories of cartographic design, Google Earth Engine apps and more!
